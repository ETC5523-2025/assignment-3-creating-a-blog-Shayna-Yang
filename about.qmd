Hi, I’m Tzu-Hsuan, Yang — a Master of Business Analytics student at Monash University, with a background in accounting and auditing. Please feel free to call me Shayna. Previously, I worked at Deloitte Taiwan, where I assisted with financial audits and internal control reviews. I’m now expanding my skills in R programming, data visualization, and reproducible analytics using Quarto. Outside of work and study, I enjoy coffee, working late at night, listening to music, and playing PC games.
