    "text": "Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a major global health issue, associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and rising healthcare costs. Estimate suggests that 20–30% of HAIs happend in Germany could be prevented with better hygiene and procedures.\nThis post summarises Germany’s HAI burden (incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years; DALYs) for five common HAIs: healthcare-associated Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), healthcare-associated primary bloodstream infections (BSI), healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (UTI), and surgical site infections (SSI) in 2011 and compares it with the EU/EEA average, using results from Zacher et al. (2019).\nThe estimates come from the ECDC Point Prevalence Survey (PPS) of HAIs (2011–2012), covering 46 representative hospitals in Germany, 1,149 hospitals across 29 EU/EEA countries, and Croatia.\nAll calculations were implemented in the BHAI R package, which performs a predefined number of Monte Carlo simulations. The workflow (Figure 1) consisted of five main steps:\nUsing BHAI, the team estimated about 478,200 HAI cases in Germany in a single year — leading to 16,200 attributable deaths and a total of 248,900 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).\nType\nCases\nDeaths\nDALYs\n\n\n\n\nHAP (pneumonia)\n106,586\n3,968\n69,508\n\n\nSSI (surgical site)\n93,222\n2,328\n28,842\n\n\nBSI (bloodstream)\n26,976\n3,905\n58,350\n\n\nUTI (urinary tract)\n214,150\n3,664\n66,701\n\n\nCDI (C. difficile)\n36,002\n1,917\n20,890\n\n\nTotal (all HAIs)\n478,222\n16,245\n248,920\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Estimated median of annual burden of five types of healthcare-associated infections in Germany, based on ECDC PPS data (2011–2012). Source: Zacher et al. (2019).\nTable 1 summarises how different infection types contributed to the total burden.\nAs shown in Figure 2, while Germany had a lower infection rate inside hospitals than the European Union average, its overall population burden was higher — 308 DALYs per 100,000 people, compared with 290 DALYs per 100,000 across the EU/EEA. This indicates that Germany experiences a high burden. These results raise a key question: if infection rates are low, why is the burden still higher?\nWhy is Germany’s burden above the EU/EEA average?\nGermany has one of the highest rates of hospital admissions and the largest number of acute care beds in Europe. This means more people are exposed to potential infections — even if hospitals themselves perform well on hygiene standards.1\nTo reduce this burden, researchers recommend:\nIn conclusion, Germany’s experience shows that reducing hospital use can be as powerful as improving hygiene — and the open-source BHAI tool makes such insights measurable for every country.\nReference:\nZacher B, Haller S, Willrich N, et al. Application of a new methodology and R package reveals a high burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) in Germany compared to the average in the European Union/European Economic Area, 2011 to 2012.
