Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a major global health issue, associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and rising healthcare costs. Estimate suggests that 20–30% of HAIs happend in Germany could be prevented with better hygiene and procedures. 

This post summarises Germany’s HAI burden (incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years; DALYs) for five common HAIs: healthcare-associated *Clostridioides difficile* infection (CDI), healthcare-associated pneumonia (HAP), healthcare-associated primary bloodstream infections (BSI), healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (UTI), and surgical site infections (SSI) in 2011 and compares it with the EU/EEA average, using results from Zacher et al. (2019).

The estimates come from the ECDC Point Prevalence Survey (PPS) of HAIs (2011–2012), covering 46 representative hospitals in Germany, 1,149 hospitals across 29 EU/EEA countries, and Croatia.

All calculations were implemented in the **BHAI R package**, which performs a predefined number of Monte Carlo simulations. The workflow (@fig-workflow) consisted of five main steps:
1. Estimate hospital prevalence of HAIs from PPS data.
2. Convert prevalence to hospital incidence using a modified Rhame–Sudderth formula and length-of-infection adjustments.
3. Extrapolate incidence to the population level using hospital discharge data in Germany.
4. Stratify by age and sex to reflect different life expectancies.
5. Adjust for different life expectancies using McCabe scores, outcome trees, and Monte Carlo simulations.

Using BHAI, the team estimated **about 478,200 HAI cases in Germany** in a single year — leading to **16,200 attributable deaths** and a total of **248,900 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)**.

@tbl-contributedburden summarises how different infection types contributed to the total burden.

As shown in @fig-results, while Germany had a **lower infection rate inside hospitals** than the European Union average, its overall **population burden** was *higher* — **308 DALYs per 100,000 people**, compared with **290 DALYs per 100,000** across the EU/EEA. This indicates that Germany experiences a high burden. These results raise a key question: if infection rates are low, why is the burden still higher?

**Why is Germany’s burden above the EU/EEA average?** 

Germany has one of the highest rates of hospital admissions and the largest number of acute care beds in Europe. This means more people are exposed to potential infections — even if hospitals themselves perform well on hygiene standards.[^1]

[^1]: These estimates should be interpreted with caution, as they rely on outcome trees informed by limited evidence, and on European McCabe score distributions, which may underestimate the German burden.

To reduce this burden, researchers recommend:

- **Reducing avoidable hospital stays**
- **Focusing further on hygiene measures**
- **Enhancing infection prevention and control**

In conclusion, Germany’s experience shows that reducing hospital use can be as powerful as improving hygiene — and the open-source BHAI tool makes such insights measurable for every country.
